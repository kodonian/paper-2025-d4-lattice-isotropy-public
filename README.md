# Isotropy of the 24-Cell (D4) Lattice

This repository contains the numerical codes used to generate the figures
in the manuscript:

"Continuum Isotropy from the Spherical 5-Design Geometry of the 24-Cell Lattice"
(C. Kovacs)

The code evaluates dispersion anisotropy, scalar and transverse mode splitting,
and elastic stiffness tensors for regular 4D lattices.

## Scope
The repository addresses kinematic and geometric properties only.
It does not implement a dynamical theory of gravity.

## Usage
Each Quarto (.qmd) script corresponds to one figure in the manuscript.
Each Python code block can be executed independently.

## Requirements
- Python ≥ 3.9
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
